# Minesweeper-P5
A basic game of minesweeper done in p5, currently a WIP
The main objective is to make a fully functional minesweeper game in JS in order to practice 2D array navigation and the challenges that come with it.

Currently the game is fully playable but it lacks some features that are core to the game, such as a mine counter.
Empty spaces opening automatically is being worked on at the moment, though it is more complicated than anticipated.
